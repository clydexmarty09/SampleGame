This game is the very first game I build on Python using the pygame library. It's essentially a "runner" game. The player continually runs, jumps, 
and moves left and right in order to avoid obsatacles. 

It uses simple if-statements, loops, and functions. 

This project is not OOP-based but I will ake updates to change that in the future.
